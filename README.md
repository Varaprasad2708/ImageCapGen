
This Image Caption Generator project uses a combination of InceptionV3 for feature extraction and a custom Transformer model for generating natural language descriptions of input images. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer.
This Project has many benefits-


1.Enhanced Accessibility:
By generating textual descriptions for images, the project makes visual content more accessible to visually impaired individuals, enabling them to better understand the content of images.

2.Automated Content Creation:
The model can assist in generating captions for social media, marketing, or documentation, saving time and effort in manual content creation.

3.Improved Image Search and Organization:
By generating meaningful captions, the project aids in tagging and organizing large image datasets, making image retrieval and categorization more efficient.
